      <h1><center>Project Description</center></h1>
  <h2>This project is meant to create thunderstorm sounds, some of which were original recordings.  It's an extremely personal piece since I had a phobia of thunderstorms for awhile.  I eventually got past this fear, but I want to help other people overcome similar weather-related phobias.</h2>
